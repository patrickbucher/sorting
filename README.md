# Sorting

Simple, higher and concurrent sorting algorithms implemented generically in
Java.

## TODO

- use PartialSort instead of Arrays.sort for small n 

## Simple Sorting Algorithms

- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Bubble Sort

## Higher Sorting Algorithms

- Heap Sort
- Quick Sort
    - Median of Three Optimization
    - Quick Insertion Sort (use Insertion Sort below a certain threshold)
- Merge Sort

## Concurrent Sorting Algorithms

- Concurrent Quick Sort
- Concurrent Merge Sort
